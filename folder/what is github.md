GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control, allowing developers to store, manage, and collaborate on code in repositories. It acts as a central hub for software projects, offering features like issue tracking, code review (via pull requests), and task management, making it easy for teams to work together, track changes, and share code globally, whether public or private.
